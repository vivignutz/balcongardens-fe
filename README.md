BALCONGARDENS is a social network plattform designed from a plant lover for plant lovers in Berlin.
The app encourages all users to contact the plants owners and exchange them. As a visitor you can also search for the plants by the plants type in case you are looking for an epecific plant one.
The users can register for the website and have access to more features such as liking your favourite plants picture that you are most interested in as well as follow certain plant's owner in order to be aware of what they will post in the future.

This part of the project is the frontend part based on the React framework, it consist of the user interface that connects and interact with the backend API through http requests.

## [](https://github.com/vivignutz/balcongardens-fe#user-experience-ux)User Experience (UX)

The project was created in order to offer a plant exchange bank for users from Berlin and the region. So could people who loves plants exchange their own double plants with others and built a nice community of plant lovers.
Some criterias in achieving this goal were identified as below:

- The main experience is to build a community of plant lovers around Berlin.
- Registered users should be able to post their plants, offering the double that they have at home, and request what they want to.
- Create functionality for users search for plants and/or other users by type and / or difficulty-level to taking care of plants.
- Registered users should be able to like and unlike the plants offered by others, to contact them for a possible pick up, and comment to posts.
- Registered users should be able to follow offerers to stay in touch with this person who is offering some plants to exchange.
- Offerers can update their information in a profile page to better presenting themselves to the others who wants to get the plants.

- User stories can be viewed in the GitHub repository and each user story has been grouped into Epics which can be displayed on the project's [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/vivignutz/projects/15).

### [](https://github.com/vivignutz/balcongardens-fe#agile-methodology)Agile methodology

- The Agile Methodology was employed throughout this project, where GitHub projects were used to create User Stories, including a list of priorities grouped into Tags. Thus, the process can be carried out with a view to the priorities of the (supposed) client.
- A lst of all issues and its labels can be found [here](https://github.com/vivignutz/balcongardens-fe/issues).

### [](https://github.com/vivignutz/balcongardens-fe#design)Design

- #### [](https://github.com/vivignutz/balcongardens-fe#color-scheme)Color Scheme

  I decided to incorporate a minimalistic design approach for the site. This is in order to make the content and detailed information throughout the site to stand out better to the users.

  The main color used is rgb(49, 49, 156) that represents a calm and trustworthy color type, in order to build trust to the user.

1.  Go to [the project repository](https://github.com/ErikHgm/FireHouse-Restaurant-Project)
2.  In the right most top menu, click the "Fork" button.
3.  There will now be a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

### [](https://github.com/vivignutz/balcongardens-fe#running-the-project-locally)Running the project locally

1.  Go to [the project repository](https://github.com/ErikHgm/FireHouse-Restaurant-Project)
2.  Click on the "Code" button.
3.  Choose one of the three options (HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI) and then click copy.
4.  Open the terminal in you IDE program.
5.  Type `git clone` and paste the URL that was copied in step 3.
6.  Press Enter and the local clone will be created.

2.  Click the green button that says "Gitpod" and the project will now open up in Gitpod.

### [](https://github.com/vivignutz/balcongardens-fe#deploying-with-heroku)Deploying with Heroku

I followed the below steps using the Code Institute tutorial:

The following command in the Gitpod CLI will create the relevant files needed for Heroku to install your project dependencies `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`. Please note this file should be added to a .gitignore file to prevent the file from being committed.

1.  Go to [Heroku.com](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) and log in; if you do not already have an account then you will need to create one.
2.  Click the `New` dropdown and select `Create New App`.
3.  Enter a name for your new project, all Heroku apps need to have a unique name, you will be prompted if you need to change it.
4.  Select the region you are working in.

#### [](https://github.com/vivignutz/balcongardens-fe#heroku-deployment)Heroku Deployment

In the Deploy tab:

1.  Connect your Heroku account to your Github Repository following these steps:
    - Click on the `Deploy` tab and choose `Github-Connect to Github`.
    - Enter the GitHub repository name and click on `Search`.
    - Choose the correct repository for your application and click on `Connect`.
2.  You can then choose to deploy the project manually or automatically, automatic deployment will generate a new application every time you push a change to Github, whereas manual deployment requires you to push the `Deploy Branch` button whenever you want a change made.
3.  Once you have chosen your deployment method and have clicked `Deploy Branch` your application will be built and you should now see the `View` button, click this to open your application.
